					The goal of the project is to create a Hololens application that
					shows a live map of where different people are at any given time.
					The personnel are tracked through a small token, which is attached to
					issued Personal Perspective Equipment (PPE), that communicates with a
					distributed tracking system that relays data to the Hololens that a
					supervisor will  utilize for monitoring purposes.
