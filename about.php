            <h4>Chandler Chockalingam</h4>
            <p> I am studying Software Engineering. I have completed three software engineering internships; two with UTC Aerospace Systems and one with Boeing. During my two internships with UTC Aerospace Systems, I worked on projects related to embedded systems and database management. During my internship this past summer with Boeing, I worked on a deep learning project that included writing Python code to build neural networks to analyze flight data. I have completed coursework at Iowa State in embedded systems, database management, operating systems, user interfaces, software architecture, and software project management.

            <h4>Logan Highland</h4>
            <p>  I am studying Software Engineering. I have just finished my first Software Engineering internship working with the security company WatchGuard Technologies working on UI/UX and Web Development. The work that I did mostly involved using Python, XSLT, and web development tools such as JavaScript, HTML, and PHP. At Iowa State I have worked with embedded systems, web development, and Android Development. I am also working on a side project that will use Arduino boards and a Google Home/Amazon Echo to communicate with a self built machine to pour mixed drinks            </p>

            <h4>Jason Ramirez</h4>
            <p>
              I am studying Computer Engineering. My industry experience is within both the manufacturing and aerospace industry. My first internship after Freshman year was with a pharma company working on a tool, written in VBA, for the human resources department. My second internship was with Procter & Gamble. There I utilized C# and reinforcement learning to make a machine on the factory floor faster by 25% (Compared to traditional humans selecting the speeds and timers). My last internship was with The Boeing Company. There I worked on an agile team making applications for both internal and external customers. My biggest project there was working on a data analytics application that dealt with unsupervised learning (text clustering to be exact) written in Python.

            <h4>Christopher Stapler</h4>
            <p> I am a senior studying Computer Engineering.This past summer,
              I was at the University of Florida working on IPOP, an open source
               user-centric virtual network, where I created a scalable testing
               environment to visualize the correctness of the VPN software
                using Bash Scripting, Python and Linux Containers (LXC).
                 Last Spring, I worked at Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines
                 (FHLBDM) as a Web Development Co-op creating web applications
                 using technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, Cucumber and
                  Hibernate. I am also very familiar with PHP and front-end
                  web technologies like Angular and Backbone Marionette having
                   worked at the Office of Student Financial Aid at Iowa State
                   for a full year before interning at FHLBDM.
